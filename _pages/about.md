\textit{Hi}! I am a rising third-year PhD student Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). My current research interests lie in the intersection of linguistics and natural language processing, especially probing language models for robustness and interpretability.

Before Penn, I was an undergrad at the [Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures](https://www.dfll.tsinghua.edu.cn/dfllen/) at Tsinghua University.
